# Connect multiple Asus routers via OpenVPN

This guide is to discuss how to connect multiple Asus routers via OpenVPN. In general, other brand routers should also work fine with OpenVPN if they support it in their official firmware. If not, it should be a little difficult to install third-party firmware like OpenWrt or Padavan for someone not familiar with them. After all, I'll use Asus's official firmware in this guide. Please let me know if you need other firmware guides.

First, let's say we have 3 routers named router0, router1 and router2. And each of them has a different ISP connected. Networking settings show in the image below. Remember those network settings are made up for convenience. Put your setting into the router's dashboard.
